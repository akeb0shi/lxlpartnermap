            <h3>21CSLA Community of Practice: Literacy Leaders, Library Staff Community of Practice</h3>
            <div class="story">School-site librarians, as on-campus literacy leaders, are uniquely positioned to impact student learning because they work across disciplines and grade levels and are the heart of literacy and reading for their sites. Often singletons at their school sites, they find themselves isolated from colleagues and having very few spaces to collaborate. For library staff and their libraries to thrive, these literacy leaders need spaces to come together as professionals to share best practices, be in community, and conduct inquiry to improve their practices. The Librarian Community of Practice convenes librarian leaders across sites and districts monthly to support their leadership identity development and increase their capacity to influence literacy achievement for all students.</div>

            <div class="story">Too often, teacher leaders are tasked with leading departments, grade-level teams, or PLCs without sufficient support for developing the unique understandings and skills necessary to facilitate learning for colleagues. Teacher Leadership in Times of Transition develops the leadership capacity of established and emerging teacher leaders, with an emphasis on the design and facilitation of powerful adult learning spaces. The program deepens leadership identity while connecting to deeper purpose, vision for equity, and core values. As part of a reflective, robust community of practice, teacher leaders from multiple Bay Area districts will hone their capacity to facilitate collaboration that improves equitable outcomes for students.</div>

            <div class="story">Every educator is navigating questions about AI in the classroom—but without educator voices leading the conversation, schools risk adopting solutions that don't work. Lead by Learning launched "AI Together," a pilot initiative to develop replicable models for community-centered AI integration that starts from a clear premise: effective AI use only happens when we deeply understand the instructional challenges we're trying to solve. The pilot creates space for educators to explore how AI can support more nuanced, student-centered instruction while helping students use AI for academic support without compromising their critical thinking. The goal is straightforward: amplifying educator expertise to ensure AI integration in schools is responsible, equitable, and genuinely effective.</div>

For the past 5 years, Lead by Learning has partnered with the Alameda Unified School District to answer this question. After developing new systemwide structures for collective ownership of district and site goals, this year our partnership is helping Professional Learning Community (PLC) Leaders district-wide improve their teams' ability to learn from focal student data, challenge equity traps, and make aligned instructional decisions. Twice-yearly impact surveys of all teachers in the district, combined with site- and district-level student achievement data disaggregated by student groups, are helping make visible the impact of PLC collaboration on student learning outcomes. Ultimately, Alameda Unified strives for systemwide coherence, where strategic changes in classroom practice are nested inside a collective vision for change, and where every adult identifies as an instructional leader with the power to work toward that vision.</div>

As a California Community School, their goal is to create a culture of instructional leadership through the formation of an Instructional Leadership Team (ILT)  who will lead grade-band PLCs. By developing their ILT identity alongside learning the mindsets and practices to guide their peers, Cherrylee Elementary is exploring how to effectively use district-wide assessments to inform their instruction school-wide.</div>

Over the course of our 5 year partnership, the ILT has become aware of the need to cultivate their collective efficacy in relation to these two focal areas, as well as striving to have a truly teacher-led ILT.  In response to a number of unpredictable transitions at their school, it has become clear just how important the ILT can be in maintaining consistency and clarity for their school community. This year, they are taking the lead in setting and maintaining school-wide policies and procedures, ensuring that staff and students experience a safe and supportive environment that promotes the success of all students.</div>

Their vision is for their cross-content PLC model to disrupt predictive outcomes for the most marginalized students in their school community, which will eventually change the types of teaching and learning across the site.  Ultimately, Dublin High School will have teacher-led PLCs that continuously use student data to decide on instructional approaches that support the social-emotional and academic growth of their students before they embark on their transition into adulthood.</div>

            <div class="story">How does a holistic focus on multilingual learners lift up all students at Halkin Elementary School? This is a key question that Lead by Learning has supported the Design and Instructional Lead Teams  to grapple with to support their adult and student learners. Located in San Leandro Unified School District, and in their fourth year of partnership with Lead by Learning, both Halkin Elementary administrators and teacher-leaders have been building a powerful learning culture that values vulnerability and rigor when analyzing classroom-based data to support  student success. As a result of this multi-year collaboaration, Halkin Elementary educators are consistent in pursuing a singular theory of action: If we pay particular attention to Halkin students who are developing their biliteracy (specifically those identified as English Learners) by building foundational literacy skills (phonics, decoding, comprehension, encoding, and meaning making), then we will see an increase in student engagement over the course of the school year, as measured by academic performance in multiple content areas.</div>

            <h3>Monroe Elementary School</h3>
            <div class="story">So many schools have initiatives that they work on without ever making significant progress, and it is not from lack of trying. The reality is that school leaders have limited time and resources, so they often have to pick and choose where to focus their energy. This is precisely what happened when it came to Action Research at Monroe. The principal and teacher leaders were bought into the idea and believed it to be a good practice, but just weren't sure about how to make it happen. Over the past 4 years, working with their ILT, Lead by Learning has been able to support them make significant progress. Through ongoing data-gathering and reflection, they identified the need to create smaller collaborative groups that were exclusively focused on Action Research, calling them Investigative Groups, or I-Groups for short. These groups proved to be effective and loved by their entire staff. This year, we continue to develop these groups with an emphasis on deeper learning through Supportive Challenge to increase math proficiency school-wide.</div>

The Oakland Unified School District Expanded Learning department is addressing this by implementing rigorous continuous quality improvement processes that transform how teams think about quality, moving far beyond basic compliance to create consistently excellent programming across every district site. With Lead by Learning's support, they're building authentic partnerships and using real site-based data to drive meaningful change that puts student experiences at the center. Success means clear improvement processes at both agency and district levels, powered by genuine insights from the ground up. The ultimate goal is simple yet transformative: ensuring every OUSD student can access the high-quality extended learning opportunities they deserve.",

            "What's the secret to transforming after-school programs? It's investing in the people who work directly with students every day. Vallejo City Unified's Expanded Learning team is supporting their Site Coordinators to develop their site staff, discovering that when adults grow professionally, student experiences improve. With Lead by Learning's support, Site Coordinators now set concrete year-long adult learning goals connected to a key quality standard—active and engaged learning—allowing them to go deep with one focus area, track progress, and assess impact. They use real-time data to make immediate program adjustments that keep quality at the center. This data-driven approach empowers Site Coordinators to respond quickly to what staff and students actually need while authentically engaging in continuous improvement. Success means creating programs where students don't just attend—they learn, grow, and thrive.",

            "How can we best distribute leadership so that all adults in a system carry the torch of delivering culturally responsive, standards-based instruction to all students? For the past 5 years, Lead by Learning has partnered with the Alameda Unified School District to answer this question. After developing new systemwide structures for collective ownership of district and site goals, this year our partnership is helping Professional Learning Community (PLC) Leaders district-wide improve their teams' ability to learn from focal student data, challenge equity traps, and make aligned instructional decisions. Twice-yearly impact surveys of all teachers in the district, combined with site- and district-level student achievement data disaggregated by student groups, are helping make visible the impact of PLC collaboration on student learning outcomes. Ultimately, Alameda Unified strives for systemwide coherence, where strategic changes in classroom practice are nested inside a collective vision for change, and where every adult identifies as an instructional leader with the power to work toward that vision.",
